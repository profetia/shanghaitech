# Same as part 4. Others are required to implement the same mechanism as rathernet to achieve the 
# same result. In rathernet, the gateway uses the identification field of the ICMP echo to 
# construct mapping between the internal and external IP addresses. The gateway then uses the
# mapping to translate the IP addresses in the ICMP echo reply. Other gateways should have exactly
# the same behavior.
